## Getting started

1. Prepare UTAU reclists that fit your needs. The reclists used in the screenshots are
   from [巽式連続音録音リスト](https://tatsu3.hateblo.jp/entry/ar426004).
2. Click the "+" button to create a new session.
3. Click the "..." button to import a reclist. If you need to import an OREMO-style comment file, please import it
   together with the reclist (a dialog will pop up to ask you to select the comment file).
4. Click the imported item, and the session will be created.
5. (Optional) If you want to use a guide BGM, click the music note button to import and select a BGM file. An
   OREMO-style BGM config file can be imported as well for continuous recording and trimming.
   Note: On Desktop, the config file should be in the same directory as the BGM file, and named
   as `<same_name_with_the_guide_bgm_file>.txt`, to be automatically detected.
6. Click the record button to start recording.
7. Click the audio graph to listen back to the recorded files.
8. After recording, click the "..." button and select "Export" or "Open Directory" to access the recorded files.

<summary>Other recommended settings</summary>

1. Install the `Kotlin KDoc Formatter` plugin, and use the following settings:
   [![KDoc Formatter settings](readme_images/kdoc_settings.png)](readme_images/kdoc_settings.png)
2. Run `./gradlew addKtlintFormatGitPreCommitHook` once to add a pre-commit hook that will automatically format your
   code before committing.
3. If in string definition files (e.g. [StringsEnglish.kt](shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/ui/string/StringEnglish.kt)), if
   the formatter of your Android Studio is always turning the wildcard imports into single imports, adjust the settings
   to allow wildcard imports on package `ui.string`.
